Using search grounding is similar to using the RAG system you implemented earlier in the week, but the Gemini API automates a lot of it for you. The model generates Google Search queries and invokes the searches automatically, retrieving relevant data from Google's index of the web and providing links to search suggestions that support the query, so your users can verify the sources.\n\n## Enable billing\n\n**Important!**\n\nGrounding with Google Search is only available through the API for **\"pay-as-you-go\"** accounts. However, you can try the feature for **no charge** in [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) to see how it works. Look out for the <img src=\"https://ai.google.dev/site-assets/images/marketing/home/icon-ais.png\" style=\"height: 24px\" height=24/> links in this guide that take you there.\n\n* Learn how to [enable billing](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/billing#enable-cloud-billing)\n* Learn about Google Cloud's [$300 credit for new customers](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/free-cloud-features) and [other no-cost options](https://cloud.google.com/free)\n* View the [pricing page](https://ai.google.dev/pricing)\n* Or try out grounding in [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) **without** billing enabled\n\nContinue on with this guide from the `API: Get set up` section if you have enabled billing for your API key, or continue to `Alternative: Use Google AI Studio` to try out the feature free of charge.","metadata":{"id":"q-mcOl0JY8Xg"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Alternative: Use Google AI Studio\n\nIf you wish to try out grounding with Google Search without enabling billing, you can use AI Studio. There are `Open in AI Studio` links in this codelab, or you can follow this short section to learn how to enable and use the feature for your own queries.\n\n### Open AI Studio\n\nStart by going to [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat). You should be in the \"New chat\" interface.\n\n![New chat in AI Studio](https://storage.googleapis.com/generativeai-downloads/kaggle/ais-newchat.png)\n\n### Ask a question\n\nNow enter a prompt into the chat interface. Try asking something that is timely and might require recent information to answer, like a recent sport score. For this query, grounding will be **disabled** by default.\n\nThis screenshow shows the response for `What were the top halloween costumes this year?`. Every execution will be different but typically the model talks about 2023, and hedges its responses saying it doesn't have access to specific information resulting in a general comment, rather than specific answers.\n\n![Sample question-answer pair without grounding](https://storage.googleapis.com/generativeai-downloads/kaggle/halloween-ungrounded.png)\n\n### Enable grounding\n\nOn the right-hand sidebar, under the `Tools` section. Find and enable the `Grounding` option.\n\n![Enable grounding button](https://storage.googleapis.com/generativeai-downloads/kaggle/enable-grounding.png)\n\nNow re-run your question by hovering over the Use prompt in the chat history, and pressing the `Edit` button that appears in the upper corner.\n\n![Edit prompt button](https://storage.googleapis.com/generativeai-downloads/kaggle/edit-button.png)\n\nThe `Edit` button will turn into the Gemini âœ¨ icon that you can press to re-run your prompt.\n\n![Re-run prompt button](https://storage.googleapis.com/generativeai-downloads/kaggle/re-run-button.png)\n\nYou should now see a response generated that references sources from Google Search.\n\n![Response with grounded sources from Google!](https://storage.googleapis.com/generativeai-downloads/kaggle/halloween-grounded.png)\n\n### Try your own queries\n\nExplore this interface and try some other queries. Share what works well in the [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1101210829807956100/1303438361117069363)! You can start from [this blank template](https://aistudio.google.com/app/prompts/1FZtxKLFZIJ1p_0rICu8K2CNIF1tkAnf4) that has search grounding enabled.\n\nThe remaining steps require an API key with billing enabled.
